# OCR_handwriting
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) extracts text from images to make them machine-readable. Since paper-based documents are not natively understood by computers, insurance companies use OCR to process handwritten documents like certificates. This project utilizes a Deep Learning algorithm (Computer Vision) to recognize characters in PDF/PNG files

This a project for the machine learning engineer bootcamp.
